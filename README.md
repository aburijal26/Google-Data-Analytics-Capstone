Google Data Analytics Professional certificate, there is an assigned case study at the end of the course, which is valuable for increasing my experience and portfolio in the field of data analysis.

I used R studio for data processing, such as cleaning and filtering, for this case study, and then Tableau to show the data.

Here are the findings from my case study. Any comments or suggestions are much welcomed.
